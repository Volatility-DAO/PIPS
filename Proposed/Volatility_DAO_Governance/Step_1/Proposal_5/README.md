| Simple Summary | This proposal will allocate funds to mint VOLunTier2 KPI options and specify the parameters of the options. |

## Abstract
Proposal 5 is a new proposal for the funding and creation of VOLunTier 2 KPI Option tokens. KPI Options are used to incentivise community participation and to draw new talent to the DAO for the growth and development of the DAO and the Volatility Protocol project.

## Motivation
Some of the KPIs for the first batch of KPI Option tokens was the creation of a second batch of options through a PIP, minting those options and creating a rollover mechanism from the first batch to the second batch. This proposal would help fulfil those KPIs as well as create another batch to be used to incentivise broader participation within the community for the growth of the DAO and for outreach efforts to expand the community around the Volatility Protocol project.

## Language For Vote

This vote will consist of 2 parts. The voting mechanism will be single choice voting (Voting types - Snapshot)

Rollover Mechanism

Token holders may roll their VOLunTier1 tokens into new VOLunTier2 tokens at an exchange rate of: 1 VOLunTier1 = 10 VOLunTier2

Users have until Feb 15th 12:00 UTC to send Tier1 into DAO Treasury. By Feb 20th 12:00 UTC the DAO will batch send VOLunTier2 Options to all those that sent into the treasury.

Option holders who miss this deadline or choose not to rollover may also choose to redeem VOLunTier1 tokens for their redemption value on UMAs UI: https://umaverse.vercel.app/0x7F7fa3678170208f197E0AD14894Df0BA2A6090d
