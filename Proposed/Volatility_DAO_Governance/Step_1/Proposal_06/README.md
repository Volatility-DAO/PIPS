| Simple Summary | Send 800,000 VOL tokens into a Sponsor Pool when the DAOracle smart contracts launch. These tokens will be used as rewards and bonds to ensure the MFIV index is audited.  |

## Motivation

In order for the Volatility Oracle to work and for the MFIV-14D-ETH volatility index to be audited, a Sponsor Pool needs to be created in the smart contracts and that Sponsor Pool needs to be funded with VOL tokens. These tokens are used as rewards to incentivize audits within the system and these tokens are used as bonds if there is a dispute witin the system. This proposal asks for 800,000 VOL to be sent when the contracts are initially launched. This will give roughly 2 weeks worth of rewards. During the initial two weeks, the DAO can determine the frequency and amount to fund the DAOracle long term.
