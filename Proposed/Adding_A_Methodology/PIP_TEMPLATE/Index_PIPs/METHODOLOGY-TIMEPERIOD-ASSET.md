# PIP Parameters

When an index is added to The Volatility Oracle, the following parameters need to be set.

**Whitelist Asset**

## How to set the target frequency for your audit.

It is beneficial to understand how `drop` and `dataPeriod` are used in combination to set the frequency of how often an index is audited.
Drop represents the number of reward tokens that are accrued each second. These reward tokens incentivize a user to pay the transaction cost of the audit. This is covered in depth in the Reward Section of the official documentation. For now, all that is needed is a cursory understanding that rewards accrue each second and are given to a user when they pay the transaction cost. You should try to set the drop parameter so that the total amount of rewards accrued overcome the transaction cost at the target frequency. For example, if audits are desired every five minutes, the average value of accrued drops should overcome the cost of transacting at five minutes.

Data period represents the time period at which snapshots of input data & index values are saved to an open-source database (e.g. IPFS). Only the most recent snapshot can be relayed to The Volatility Oracle for audit and it can only be audited once, subsequent submissions of the same snapshot to The Volatility Oracle are denied. Data period can be set to any time resolution, with a minimum interval of 1 minute (e.g. 5 minutes or 1 hour) but should never be greater than the desired amount of time between audits.

## Setting Drop

You can use the [spreadsheet here](./Set_Drop.xlsx) to determine what the drop should be. Only change the fields highlighted in green on the first and second tabs. You can view Gas_Estimates.png for the latest gas costs of the Volatility Oracle.
