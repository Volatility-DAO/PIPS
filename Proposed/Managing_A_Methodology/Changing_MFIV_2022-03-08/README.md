# Change MFIV

Give reasons and/or evidence for why MFIV should be changed.

Delete Implementation_Parameters.md
* This file is being deleted because it is no longer part of the PIP process.
* It does not affect the implementation.
* It does not affect the fidelity of the MFIV implementation compared to the MFIV.pdf.

Delete MFIV_PIP.md
* This file is being deleted because it is no longer part of the PIP process. These parameters are now in MFIV-14D-ETH.md
* It does not affect the implementation.
* It does not affect the fidelity of the MFIV implementation compared to the MFIV.pdf.

ADD Index_PIPs Directory
* This directory was added because there is a new process for adding an index to a methodology and we want MFIV to reflect that.
* It does not affect the implementation.
* It does not affect the fidelity of the MFIV implementation compared to the MFIV.pdf.

ADD METHODOLOGY_CONFIG.md (Index_PIPs Directory)
* This file was added because there is a new process for adding an index to a methodology and we want MFIV to reflect that. This file is the instructions for how to edit the config file.
* It does not affect the implementation.
* It does not affect the fidelity of the MFIV implementation compared to the MFIV.pdf.

ADD MFIV-14D-ETH.md  (Index_PIPs Directory)
* This file was added because there is a new process for adding an index to a methodology and we want MFIV to reflect that. This file is the new way of setting parameters for this index in the DAOracle.
* It does not affect the implementation.
* It does not affect the fidelity of the MFIV implementation compared to the MFIV.pdf.

ADD methodology_config.yaml  (Index_PIPs Directory)
* This file was added because there is a new process for adding an index to a methodology and we want MFIV to reflect that. This file reflects the parameters of the MFIV-14D-ETH.md
* It does not affect the implementation.
* It does not affect the fidelity of the MFIV implementation compared to the MFIV.pdf.

README.md
* This file was added because we want to use a UNIX timestamp in the IPFS URL instead of an ISO timestamp. This is important because UMA's OO will receive the timestamp in UNIX and we do not want users to have to convert to ISO.
* It does not affect the implementation.
* It does not affect the fidelity of the MFIV implementation compared to the MFIV.pdf.
