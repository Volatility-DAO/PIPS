#PIPS

NOTE - THIS PROCESS IS CURRENTLY BEING CREATED THROUGH AN ITERATIVE PROCESS. TO GIVE FEEDBACK PLEASE JOIN THE VOLATILITY DAO DISCORD AND LOOK IN THE [PIPS](https://discord.com/channels/807306992389062668/904816574215635025) CHANNEL.

Protocol Improvement Plans are used to add an index to the DAOracle, remove an index from the DAOracle, or to change the parameters of how an index interacts with DAOracle.

## Adding an Index through a PIP

In order for an index to be added it needs to go through the following steps. If any of these steps fail, then the PIP for adding the index is considered Failed.

### Step 1 - Propose Methodology

Anyone can publicly post an idea that they have for a methodology on the [Volatilty Protocol Forum](forum.volatilty.com). The purpose of an idea is to elicit lots of feedback. Therefore, itâ€™s good practice to do the following:
1. Tag your post with [IDEA]. Both in the title and with the tag.

You do not need to post the ideo for your methodology in the forum to propose a methodology but it will help with getting early feedback on your idea.
 
To submit a formal version of your methodology, take the following steps:

1. Write your methodology as a formal mathematical document and save it as a .pdf.
2. Clone this repo and submit a .pdf of your methodology through a pull request to PIPS/Proposed/Methodologies.
3. Notify @everyone in the [pips](https://discord.com/channels/807306992389062668/904816574215635025) channel of the Volatility DAO discord of the pull request.

Users will ask questions about your methodology which you should answer.
