# Protocol Improvement Proposals (PIPs)

Protocol Improvement Proposals (PIPs) are used to make specific changes to the Volatility DAOracle. A PIP can be in one of four states:

|PIP State| Definition|
|-------- |-----------|
|Approved | These are PIPs that have passed through the process and are now a part of the DAOracle.|
|Proposed | These are PIPs that are in the process of being considered for the DAOracle.|
|Removed  | These are PIPs that were at one time part of the DAOracle but have been removed.|
|Failed   | These are PIPs where the pull request was approved but the governance vote failed.|


## Submit a PIP
All PIPs go through an iterative process of submission where they move from an Idea -> Formal Feedback -> Voting -> Approved/Failed. The particular steps to get a PIP approved is dependent on the type of PIP you are submitting.

To contribure to this repo or to submit a PIP, follow the instructions for the type of PIP you are creating:

1. [Volatility DAO Governance](Proposed/Volatility_DAO_Governance/README.md) - Use this process if you want to create a governance proposal specifically for the Volatility DAO (e.g. not specific to the DAOracle).
2. [Adding an Index](Proposed/Adding_An_Index/README.md) - Use this process if you want to submit an index to the DAOracle.
3. [Removing an Index](Proposed/Removing_An_Index/README.md) - Use this process if you want to remove an index from the DAOracle.
4. [Changing Parameters](Proposed/Changing_Parameters/README.md) - Use this process if you want to change the parameters of a PIP which has already been approved for the DAOracle.
5. [Changing Approved Code](Proposed/Changing_Approved_Code/README.md) - Use this process if you want to contribute to open-source code for PIPs that have been approved.
